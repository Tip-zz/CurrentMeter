# CurrentMeter
Current Meter, +/-2.5ADC
I did this project to measure the current drawn by various electronics projects.
While I have a nice multi-meter, it gives very erratic readings when measuring modest current in digital circuits.
The meter I designed provides stable readings with 1mA resolution over a range of +/-2.5A.
The software is developed under the Arduino 1.8.19 IDE and is written using the Arduino C++ variant.
